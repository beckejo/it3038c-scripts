For my Project 1, I followed a tutorial from TokyoEdtech that shows how to create a simple snake game. Tutorials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEgNdBJEO-n8k9SR49AshB9j7b5Iw7hZ
I follow a similar format to his code and game, with some adjustments to variable names, game tick time, game window size, and speed of the snake.

The goal of the script was to create a simple game that is played in its own window, and that keeps track of a score and high score, as well as a snake length stat.
To run the game, download and run the file JaySnake.py
